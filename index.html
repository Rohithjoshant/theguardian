        <!-- 5.1 -->
        <article class="analysis-card">
          <span class="meta-source">5.1 • UN / Netanyahu (ABC News)</span>
          <h3>The Empty Stage and Performed Authority</h3>
          <p>
            This image responds to reporting by ABC News on Benjamin Netanyahu delivering a contentious speech at the United Nations. 
            The reporting provides context, but the emptiness in the illustration is my artistic choice rather than a claim about the real event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UN chamber is shown as almost empty, with harsh stage lighting and a lone figure walking away. 
            The emptiness works as a metaphor for how global platforms can feel like performances where the stage remains powerful even when dialogue feels fractured or absent. 
            The podium becomes a prop, and the lighting turns the hall into a set.
          </p>

        <!-- 5.2 -->
        <article class="analysis-card">
          <span class="meta-source">5.2 • Trump / Media (Symbolic)</span>
          <h3>Media Control and the Puppet Stage</h3>
          <p>
            This image is a symbolic interpretation of perceived influence over media narratives. 
            Trump is represented as a puppeteer above a curtain line, pulling strings linked to media icons. 
            It is not a factual claim of direct control, but a metaphor for how repeated messaging can feel guided and staged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The comedy and tragedy masks frame the scene to show how media cycles swing between entertainment and crisis. 
            The curtain suggests hidden processes shaping what the public receives.
          </p>

        <!-- 5.3 -->
        <article class="analysis-card">
          <span class="meta-source">5.3 • Mamdani (ABC News)</span>
          <h3>Voting, Approval, and the Performance of Participation</h3>
          <p>
            This image responds to ABC News reporting on Zohran Mamdani addressing New Yorkers after the election result. 
            The focus is not on judging the individual, but on how approval is staged visually.
          </p>
          <p>
            The image shows a leader above and a crowd below repeating simplified symbols like checkmarks. 
            The checkmark represents how complex decisions become reduced into single icons: approval, legitimacy, success. 
            The crowd is shown as a mass rather than individuals, reflecting how participation is often displayed as numbers and signs.
          </p>

        <!-- 5.4 -->
        <article class="analysis-card">
          <span class="meta-source">5.4 • UN / Gaza (Al Jazeera)</span>
          <h3>The Veto and Distant Power</h3>
          <p>
            This image responds to reporting by Al Jazeera on the United States vetoing a UN Security Council demand for a Gaza ceasefire. 
            The composition is split: the chamber above and destruction below. That separation is the main meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single raised hand beneath the word “VETO” turns procedure into a small gesture with huge consequences. 
            The bottom half shows the cost through smoke, fire, and collapsed buildings. 
            The word “VETO” acts like a stage cue, reinforcing the idea that formal actions can be performed at a distance from human impact.
          </p>

        <!-- 5.5 -->
        <article class="analysis-card">
          <span class="meta-source">5.5 • Epstein Files (Al Jazeera)</span>
          <h3>Promises, Redaction, and Performed Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            This image responds to Al Jazeera reporting on Donald Trump shifting his stance on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files. 
            It focuses on the conflict between promise and access.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work contrasts a confident public statement about “releasing” files with documents dominated by heavy redaction. 
            The redaction bars are the core symbol: information exists, but access is controlled. 
            The image reflects how transparency can be staged as performance while still being restricted in practice.
          </p>
        </article>

        <!-- 5.6 -->
        <article class="analysis-card">
          <span class="meta-source">5.6 • Maduro (Tempo English)</span>
          <h3>Removal from the Stage and Loss of Authority</h3>
          <p>
            This image references Tempo English reporting on Nicolás Maduro and his wife being arrested and flown to New York. 
            The scene shifts away from public stage spaces into a controlled interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leader is shown seated with headset equipment and dark eyewear, creating a sense of surveillance and containment. 
            There is no crowd, microphone, or public setting. The water bottle normalises the scene and makes it more unsettling.
